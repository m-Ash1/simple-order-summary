## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to construct the layout with divs in HTML and flex property in CSS

For any element I used way to center them by flexbox for example:
```html
  <div class="centered-summary">
       <h1>Order Summary</h1>
       <p>You can now listen to millions of songs, audiobooks, and podcasts on any device anywhere you like!</p>
  </div>
```
This CSS lines helped me a lot to center elements and it makes it easier than padding and margin centering way 
```css
.centered-summary {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```


### Continued development

In the future I will try different ways to build the layout of the page. I will search more on grid and practice more on using flexbox

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.asp) - This helped me to understand the box shadow and have a lot of tries on it.
